# Facial-emotions-detections-system

Welcome to the Facial Emotion Detection project! This project aims to detect and recognize human emotions from facial expressions using machine learning and computer vision techniques. By analyzing facial features such as eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and overall facial expressions, the system can classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear.

Features:

Real-time Emotion Detection: The system is capable of detecting emotions in real-time through webcam or pre-recorded video input.
Multi-class Emotion Classification: Emotions are classified into multiple classes including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, and fear.
Accuracy and Performance: The system is designed to provide accurate emotion detection with efficient performance, ensuring smooth user experience.
Easy Integration: The project is implemented using common programming libraries and frameworks, making it easy to integrate into existing applications or projects.
Customization: Users can fine-tune and customize the model according to their specific requirements, including training on custom datasets or modifying the model architecture.
